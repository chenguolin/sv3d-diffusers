# SV3D-diffusers

![](assets/sv3doutputs.gif)

This repo provides scripts about:

1. Spatio-temporal UNet (`SV3DUNetSpatioTemporalConditionModel`) and pipeline (`StableVideo3DDiffusionPipeline`) modified from [SVD](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_video_diffusion/pipeline_stable_video_diffusion.py) for [SV3D](https://sv3d.github.io) in the [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) convention.

2. Converting the [Stability-AI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models)'s [SV3D-p UNet checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d) to the [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) convention.

3. Infering the `SV3D-p` model with the [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library to synthesize a 21-frame orbital video around a 3D object from a single-view image (preprocessed by removing background and centering first).

Converted SV3D-p checkpoints have been uploaded to HuggingFaceðŸ¤— [chenguolin/sv3d-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/chenguolin/sv3d-diffusers).

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenguolin/sv3d-diffusers.git
# Please install PyTorch first according to your CUDA version
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# If you can't access to HuggingFaceðŸ¤—, try:
# export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
python3 infer.py --output_dir out/ --image_path assets/images/sculpture.png --elevation 10 --half_precision --seed -1
```
The synthesized video will save at `out/` as a `.gif` file.


## ðŸ“¸ Results
> Image preprocessing and random seed for different implementations are different, so the results are presented only for reference.
